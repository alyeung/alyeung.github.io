# This is my General Assembly Front End Web Development Project

## Introduction
Final project is under [/final_project_template](href="https://alyeung.github.io/final_project_template/)

Initially, I was inspired to create one of the following pages:

1.  Cell phone deals aggregator inspired by these [tiles](https://erickv.github.io/finalassignment_v2/)
2.  Visualizing resources for new bicyclists or non-car drivers in Seattle.  I like the idea of visualing with [Google Maps](http://seattlebackstory.com/)
3.  Dog owner resources with links to recommended products, perhaps playing with mapping of great spots in Seattle along with tiles for recommended products
4.  Mapping of tennis court facilities in the greater Seattle area, with links to stores and popular resources
5.  Mock up integration with payments interface because the payment forms look great on mobile

Finally, decided that a portfolio page would be best for future opportunities.

## What was tricky?
1.  Getting the Youtube videos on the blog page to pause, when the modal pop-up is closed
2.  Youtube embed iFrame was causing only the first Youtube video to show up on each pop up modal
3.  Replacing the placebear placeholder images with my own content images for the site, which took forever
4.  Styling, centering, positioning, and making the content look nice

## What are you especially excited about being able to accomplish?

4. Learn by doing, for example digging into using Git/Github via the command line
5. The Uber-like bottom menu on index.html that is responsive and looks really nice on a mobile devices

## Known bugs or features to add in the future

1. Get FormSpree.io form working
2. Take advantage of SASS to better structure the css
3. Try out AJAX and storing content in a database, and injecting that into the HTML
4. Integrating a QA workflow with some of the tools provided in class, and creating a repeatable creation process
