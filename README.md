# This is my General Assembly Front End Web Development Project
:+1: :+1: 

## Introduction
:sunny:
Final project is under [/final_project_template](https://alyeung.github.io/final_project_template/)

Initially, I was inspired to create one of the following pages:

1.  Cell phone deals aggregator inspired by these [tiles](https://erickv.github.io/finalassignment_v2/)
2.  Visualizing resources for new bicyclists or non-car drivers in Seattle.  I like the idea of visualing with [Google Maps](http://seattlebackstory.com/)
3.  Dog owner resources with links to recommended products, perhaps playing with mapping of great spots in Seattle along with tiles for recommended products
4.  Mapping of tennis court facilities in the greater Seattle area, with links to stores and popular resources
5.  Mock up integration with payments interface because the payment forms look great on mobile

Finally, decided that a portfolio page would be best for future opportunities.

## Site walkthrough
:walking:
1.  :floppy_disk: On [index.html](https://alyeung.github.io/final_project_template/index.html) is the porfolio page, where you can use the bottom menu to navigate through: Data Insights, Software Development, Product Management, and Fun Stuff
2.  :iphone: In the upper left is a sandwich bar which will open the side menu to navigate the other 3 pages
3. :eyeglasses: [blog.html](https://alyeung.github.io/final_project_template/blog.html) in inspired from [AWS Technology blog](final_project_template/images/AWS_Blog_Inspiration.png), and some of my favorite technologies
4. :bike: [map.html](https://alyeung.github.io/final_project_template//map.html) is dedicated to those who have yet to get started with bicycling in Seattle
5.  [feedback.html](https://alyeung.github.io/final_project_template//feedback.html) is a contact form with error checking and a Github contact tiles

## How did you accomplish what you accomplished?
:raised_hands:
1. Start with something small, get it working, then add onto it
2. Re-use class exercises for ideas as they stylistically look great
3. Use [Codepen](https://codepen.io/alyeung/), Stack Overlow, and Google search

## What is the ultimate goal of this site?
:running:
1. Responsive portfolio that I can show during a discussion, and it acts as a passive advertisement of my capabilities
2. A project or code with pictures speaks louder than the typical resume or Linkedin profile
2. Fan page for Amazon Web Services and Bicycling in Seattle

## Is your design responsive?  Show us!
:iphone:
Yes!  Narrow the page to < 660 pixels, or view on your cell phone

# Process Discussion
:bowtie:
1.  Ideate on some site ideas including as discussed in the introduction
2.  Created wire diagrams: [wire 1](final_project_template/images/wire1.jpg), [wire 2](final_project_template/images/wire2.jpg), [wire 3](final_project_template/images/wire3.jpg)
3.  Created html pages without any styling, just dropped elements
4.  Started styling
5.  Pseudo code for javascript, and then taking inspiration from class exercises

## What was tricky?
:cry:
1.  Getting the Youtube videos on the blog page to pause, when the modal pop-up is closed
2.  Youtube embed iFrame was causing only the first Youtube video to show up on each pop up modal
3.  Adding the slick Jquery code correctly, as there is a dependency on other HTML pages even if the HTML page does not use the plug in due to using the same JS file.
4.  Replacing the placebear placeholder images with my own content images for the site, which took forever
5.  Styling, centering, positioning, and making the content look nice

## What are you especially excited about being able to accomplish?
:muscle:
1. Creating a portfolio page, that reflects my recent experience and capabilities
2. while including some fun items such as my passion around Amazon Web Services technology and tools
3. A github repository that reflects my coding style for HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery
4. Learn by doing, for example digging into using Git/Github via the command line
5. The Uber-like bottom menu on index.html that is responsive and looks really nice on a mobile devices

## Known bugs or features to add in the future
:computer:

1. Get FormSpree.io form working
2. Take advantage of SASS to better structure the css
3. Try out AJAX and storing content in a database, and injecting that into the HTML
4. Integrating a QA workflow with some of the tools provided in class, and creating a repeatable creation process
5. Here is the full list: [Issues List](https://github.com/alyeung/alyeung.github.io/issues)
